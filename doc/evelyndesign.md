### Agile

Work is organised into stories and tasks. Both of these can be linked to a sprint, which is an iteration of work.

**Incomplete tasks**
You can always look up a task directly, but otherwise it can be found as follows
- If it is linked to a sprint, it will be visible when that sprint is looked up.
- If it is linked to a story it will be visible when that story is looked up.
- If it is assigned to you, it will be visible when you look up your assigned tasks.
- If it is unassigned and not linked to a story or sprint, then it will be visible on the project backlog

**Incomplete stories**
A story is defined as incomplete if it has any incomplete tasks linked to it and has not been marked complete. Note that, a story which had been marked complete _is complete_ even if it has open tasks or tasks are re-opened.

You can always look up a story directly, but otherwise it can be found as follows
- If it is linked to a sprint, then it will be visible when that sprint is looked up.
- If it is not linked to a sprint, then it will be visible on the project backlog.
- If a task which is linked to the story is being viewed, then the owning story can be looked up from the task.

**Incomplete sprints**
A sprint is unfinished if its end time is in the future or it has incomplete stories or tasks. A sprint is therefore incomplete if it is unfinished and has not been marked commplete. Note that this means a sprint which has been marked complete *is complete* even if the end time has not passed or there are still incomplete stories or tasks linked to it.

You can always look up a sprint directly, but otherwise it can be found as follows
- If the current time is between the sprint start and end times, then the sprint is active, and so is visible by default.
- If the current time is before the sprint start time, then this is an unstarted sprint and is visible when looking up the project backlog.
